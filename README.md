# Priscilla
Priscilla is the telegram pun bot goddess. It is written in golang and it serves to PUN-nish you (pun intended).

## Why Priscilla was created?
Priscilla was created to explore telegram bots and golang. In addition, Priscilla would also be used to track most commonly used words for shit and giggles (in progress).

## How to use Priscilla?
As long as Priscilla is hosted somewhere, add it to your telegram chat and it will start monitoring whatever the group is saying. Upon detecting certain keywords, Priscilla will reply with a pun.

## Possible improvements
1. Currently keywords to pun is a one on one mapping, need to look into many to many mapping with randomizer so that users do not always get the same puns.
2. Explore into using webhook instead of long polling.
3. Implement some form of data storage or tracking of most commonly used words.
